####About Me

My name is Andy Trick and I'm based out of Chicago, IL. I've been touring around as bassist of the metal band, <a href="https://www.tdwpband.com/">The Devil Wears Prada</a> for the past 12 years. When not playing music, I spend my time learning data science through both traditional (Southern New Hampshire University) and nontraditional (Udacity, Udemy) methods. I enjoy looking into the hidden patterns found in data and visualizing these in interesting ways. I also enjoy training <a href="http://www.japaneseculturecenter.com/">Aikido</a>.

####About this website

I created this blog in hopes to have a location to aggregate all my past, current, and future undertakings into the subjects of data science. As such, this site holds a collection of personal projects, past assignments for school/certificate programs, and anything else that seems to fit with this goal.
