####About Me

My name is Andy and I'm based out of Chicago, IL. I'm a founding member and the bassist for metal band, <a href="https://www.tdwpband.com/">The Devil Wears Prada</a>, and for the past 13 years have been touring internationally playing music. 
<br><br>
I'm passionate about numbers in any form and have spent the past five years gaining knowledge and experience in the world of data science; in particular focusing on statistics, data visualization, and machine learning. Professionally, I'm adept at analyzing and interpreting data to support decision-making and solve business problems. Personally, I spend my free time looking into hidden patterns found in different types of data and visualizing these in stimulating ways. I am a firm believe that sharing and highlighting the unapparent trends and inequalities found in societal data can lead to a more understanding and egalitarian world. 
<br><br>
Outside of data and music, I also enjoy the sci-fi/fantasy genre, running, yoga, and training <a href="http://www.japaneseculturecenter.com/">Aikido</a>.

####About this website

I created this blog to have a location to aggregate all my past, current, and future undertakings into the subjects of data science. As such, this site holds a collection of personal projects, past assignments for school/certificate programs, and anything else that seems to fit with this goal.
