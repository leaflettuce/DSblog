Summary: I found some free time and, as I've been looking to get some practice at dimensionality reduction, I went and found a competition on Kaggle (Estimate house prices) which looked appropriate for practice at this skill. I walk through the step I took from cleaning and standardizing the data, to finally performing PCA and fitting a simple linear regression to the top five most influential eigenvectors!
