    "This is not to say it will not be effective in round two of the competition where current tourney data is unavaible.  I believe my model's use of only regular season data is both a pro and a con.  It can allow me to appropriately fit each game in the 2018 bracket based soley on regular season data from this year. Conversely, it also does not take into account the randomness that is seen within Tourny games- Hence the 'madness' of the bracket. \n",
