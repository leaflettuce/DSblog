Summary: It's been a little over three years since I attempted my first ML project of classifying survival of the titanic.. A pretty famous dataset and task for this field I'd say. I achieved a accuracy of around 75% in my first attempt at this (I believe with a random forest model). I though it would be nice to revisit this and give it another go now that I'm a little more experienced. Additionally, I've wanted to explore ensemble learned some more, particularly XGBoost. Let's dive in!
